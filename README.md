Sentiment Analysis and Visualization of Social Media Data 
Sentiment Analysis and Visualization of Social Media Data
This project analyzes and visualizes sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands. The key steps involved are:

Data Collection: Collecting social media posts or comments using APIs (like Twitter or Facebook Graph API) to retrieve data related to the target topics or brands.

Text Preprocessing: Cleaning the data by removing stop words, punctuation, and irrelevant content, followed by tokenization and stemming/lemmatization.

Sentiment Analysis: Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like VADER or TextBlob to classify the sentiment of each post into positive, negative, or neutral categories.

Data Visualization: Creating visualizations using libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly to represent the sentiment distribution, time trends, and word clouds that capture key topics discussed.

Insights: Identifying sentiment trends, spikes in public opinion, and key moments driving discussions, which help in understanding how a brand or topic is perceived over time.

This analysis can help businesses or researchers track public opinion, spot emerging trends, and take data-driven decisions to improve engagement strategies.

Analysis 

This code generates two visualizations to analyze the sentiment distribution in the y_train dataset:

Pie Chart: It shows the percentage breakdown of the four sentiment classes (Positive, Neutral, Negative, Irrelevant).

Bar Plot: It represents the actual count of each sentiment class, providing a visual comparison of how many samples fall into each category.

Key Observations and Conclusions:

Sentiment Imbalance: The pie chart and bar plot will reveal whether the dataset is balanced or imbalanced in terms of sentiment classes.
If one sentiment (e.g., Negative or Irrelevant) dominates, it may suggest a need for balancing the dataset. For example, using techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or SMOTE might be necessary.
Imbalanced datasets can lead to biased models, where the model may perform well on the majority class but poorly on minority classes.

Class Representation:

The pie chart provides a quick overview of how each sentiment contributes to the overall data, which helps understand the general mood or opinion distribution.
The bar plot shows the exact counts, making it easier to compare the distribution and spot any significant differences between sentiment types.

Model Impact:

If some sentiments have very few samples, the model may struggle to learn patterns from these underrepresented classes. In such cases, alternative strategies (e.g., using different evaluation metrics like F1-score instead of accuracy) should be considered to ensure the model performs well across all sentiment classes.

Data Quality:

The chart also provides insights into data quality. For example, if there are more "Irrelevant" sentiments than expected, it might indicate that some of the data is not well-targeted for the sentiment analysis task and could be cleaned or reclassified.

By examining the two charts, you'll gain a clear picture of whether the sentiment distribution is even, or if certain sentiment classes dominate, which can affect model performance and the insights drawn from the analysis.
